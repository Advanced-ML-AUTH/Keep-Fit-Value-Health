    "For example, soups made with bone-, vegetable-, or meat-based broths provide vitamins, minerals, and nutrients, such as collagen. They also deliver great flavor while keeping added fats and calories to a minimum. Additionally, eating soup is an easy and tasty way to increase your vegetable intake. Eating soup can help you stay hydrated. Water is essential for your health, and your total water intake may come from drinking water, water in beverages, or water in food — as is the case for soup, fruits, and vegetables.\n",

Just as choosing nutrient-rich ingredients will lead to a healthy soup, some ingredients used to improve texture or taste may produce an unhealthy dish that you might want to eat less frequently. Some of the most popular ingredients used to thicken soups include full fat milk, heavy cream, coconut cream, cornstarch, bread, cheese, egg yolks, and roux — a mixture of butter and flour. Other types of soup you should watch out for are instant and canned soups, which are often loaded with sodium."
